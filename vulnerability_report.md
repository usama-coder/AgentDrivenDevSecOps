### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: flask - Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.
https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' to False, the session will not be automatically refreshed and resent with each request, reducing the risk of session data being cached and sent to other clients by a proxy.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-23934: Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like '=value' instead of 'key=value'. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like '=__Host-test=bad' for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie '=__Host-test=bad' as __Host-test=bad'. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-25577: Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses 'request.data', 'request.form', 'request.files', or 'request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)', it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
request.form['input_data']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use request.form.get('input_data') instead
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the get method instead of directly accessing the form data using square brackets, we can prevent potential KeyError exceptions if the 'input_data' key does not exist in the form data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 3.0.1 and 2.3.8 include a security fix: Slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS attacks.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/b1916c0c083e0be1c9d887ee2f3d696922bfc5c1

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
password = request.form.get('password')
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
password = request.form['password']
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using request.form['password'] instead of request.form.get('password') ensures that the password field is required and will raise a KeyError if it is not present, which can help prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as missing or empty password values.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
debug = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
debug = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting the debug mode to False will disable the debugger in Werkzeug, reducing the risk of allowing an attacker to execute code on the developer's machine.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) on Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11. The safe_join() function failed to properly detect certain absolute paths on Windows, allowing attackers to potentially access files outside the intended directory. An attacker could craft special paths starting with "/" that bypass the directory restrictions on Windows systems. The vulnerability exists in the safe_join() function which relied solely on os.path.isabs() for path validation. This is exploitable on Windows systems by passing paths starting with "/" to safe_join(). To remediate, upgrade to the latest version which includes additional path validation checks. 
NOTE: This vulnerability specifically affects Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11 where ntpath.isabs() behavior differs.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
safe_join("/path/to/directory", "/../sensitive_file")
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use os.path.normpath() to normalize the paths before passing them to safe_join.
```

#### Recommendation Description
By normalizing the paths using os.path.normpath(), we can ensure that any attempts at path traversal using "../" or similar techniques are resolved to their correct paths before being passed to safe_join. This helps prevent attackers from accessing files outside the intended directory.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are potentially vulnerable to resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms. Applications using 'werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser' to parse 'multipart/form-data' requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.form['data']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.form.get('data')
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using get() method instead of directly accessing the form data helps to prevent potential KeyError if the 'data' key does not exist in the form.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.get_data()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_data(parse_form_data=True)
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting the parse_form_data parameter to True will parse the incoming form data, preventing potential denial of service attacks by maliciously crafted multipart data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to Middleware Cache Pollution. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially interfere with middleware handling by exploiting cached middleware associated with system routes. The impact includes possible bypassing of security middleware or unintended access to internal routes. The attack vector involves crafting requests that target system routes, causing the middleware cache to store and reuse inappropriate middleware configurations. The vulnerable methods are _build_middlewares and the middleware caching mechanism in web_app.py. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version, which prevents system routes from polluting the middleware cache by excluding SystemRoute instances from caching.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.middlewares.append(middleware)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.middlewares.append(middleware) if not isinstance(middleware, SystemRoute) else None
```

#### Recommendation Description
By checking if the middleware being added is an instance of SystemRoute before appending it to the middlewares list, we can prevent system routes from polluting the middleware cache.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTTP messages by including line feeds (LF) in chunk extensions, potentially bypassing security controls and executing unauthorized actions. The attack vector involves sending specially crafted chunked HTTP requests to exploit the improper parsing in the HttpPayloadParser class. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version which validates chunk extensions by rejecting any containing unexpected LFs, thereby preventing request smuggling attacks.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app = web.Application()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app = web.Application(client_max_size=0)
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting the client_max_size parameter to 0 in the web.Application() constructor helps mitigate potential HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerabilities by preventing the server from accepting chunked requests. This reduces the risk of malicious HTTP messages being injected into the server.

----------------------------------------

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}'".format(user_input)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using parameterized queries with placeholders, we can prevent SQL injection attacks that could occur when directly formatting user input into the SQL query string.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: jinja2 - A vulnerability in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker who can control both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, bypassing Jinja's sandbox protections. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to manipulate both the template's filename and its contents. The risk depends on the application's specific use case. This issue affects applications that render untrusted templates where the attacker can determine the template filename, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST['template'])
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST.get('template', ''))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the get method instead of directly accessing the 'template' key in the POST request, we can prevent potential KeyError exceptions and ensure that an empty string is used as the default value if 'template' key is not present in the request.

**Description**: langchain - Langchain 0.0.329 includes a fix for CVE-2023-32786: Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6h8p-4hx9-w66c

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
url = request.args.get('url')
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
url = request.args.get('url', type=str)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By specifying the type as 'str' when getting the URL parameter from the request arguments, we ensure that only string values are accepted, reducing the risk of potential security vulnerabilities such as SSRF attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - langchain-ai/langchain is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in its LocalFileStore functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read or write files anywhere on the filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution. The issue lies in the handling of file paths in the mset and mget methods, where user-supplied input is not adequately sanitized, allowing directory traversal sequences to reach unintended directories.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(self.base_path, file_name)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(self.base_path), os.path.basename(file_name))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using os.path.abspath() on the base_path and os.path.basename() on the file_name, we ensure that the file_path cannot be manipulated to perform a path traversal attack. This restricts the file_path to be within the base_path directory.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - In versions of Langchain-ai before 0.1.0, a vulnerability exists where a crawler, using a specified configuration, could mistakenly download malicious content from an external site. This occurs when an attacker adds a malicious HTML file on https://example.com that includes links to outside sites, contrary to the crawler's settings intended to restrict such actions.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
if len(response.content) < 500:
    print(response.content)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
if len(response.content) < 500:
    print(response.text)
```

#### Recommendation Description
To avoid potential security risks, it is recommended to access the response content as text instead of binary data to prevent unintended execution of malicious content.

**Description**: langchain - Langchain addresses path traversal vulnerability CVE-2024-28088 by deprecating certain functionality in its recursive URL loader, enhancing security against unsanitized user input exploitation.
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18600

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, user_input)
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, os.path.basename(user_input))
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using `os.path.basename()` on the user input before constructing the file path, we ensure that the user input cannot be used to perform a path traversal attack. This restricts the file access to within the specified base path and prevents access to files outside of it.
