#### Vulnerable Code
```python
password = 'SuperSecret12as3'
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use environment variables or a secure storage solution to store sensitive information like passwords.
```

#### Recommendation Description
Storing passwords directly in the code can expose them to potential attackers who may gain access to the codebase. Using environment variables or a secure storage solution adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive information.

----------------------------------------

### File: codeScan.py, Line: 22
**Description**: Use of insecure MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1 hash function.

**Severity**: MEDIUM

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
```

#### Recommendation Description
Replacing the use of MD5 with SHA256 for hashing passwords provides a more secure option for storing sensitive information.

**Description**: flask - Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:

1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.

2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'

3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.

4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).

5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' to False, the session will not be refreshed and re-sent without being accessed or modified, reducing the risk of caching sensitive data intended for one client.

**Description**: sqlalchemy - Sqlalchemy 2.0.0b1 avoids leaking cleartext passwords to the open for careless uses of str(engine.URL()) in logs and prints.

https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/pull/8563

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///' + db_path)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///' + db_path, echo=False)
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting echo=False will prevent SQLAlchemy from logging sensitive information such as passwords.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-23934: Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like '=value' instead of 'key=value'. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like '=__Host-test=bad' for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie '=__Host-test=bad' as __Host-test=bad'. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.

https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    if check_credentials(username, password):
        session['logged_in'] = True
        flash('Logged in successfully!')
    else:
        flash('Invalid credentials. Please try again.')
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    if username is not None and password is not None and check_credentials(username, password):
        session['logged_in'] = True
        flash('Logged in successfully!')
    else:
        flash('Invalid credentials. Please try again.')
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using `request.form.get()` instead of `request.form[]`, we can prevent potential KeyError if 'username' or 'password' keys are not present in the form data. Additionally, we should check if both 'username' and 'password' are not None before attempting to validate the credentials.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-25577: Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses 'request.data', 'request.form', 'request.files', or 'request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)', it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.

https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
request.data
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use request.get_data(parse_form_data=False) instead of request.data
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using request.get_data(parse_form_data=False), we can prevent Werkzeug from parsing an unlimited number of parts, including file parts, which can lead to high resource usage and potential denial of service attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 3.0.1 and 2.3.8 include a security fix: Slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS attacks.

https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/b1916c0c083e0be1c9d887ee2f3d696922bfc5c1

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = request.form['input']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = request.form.get('input', '')
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using get() method instead of directly accessing the dictionary key helps to avoid KeyError if the key is not present in the dictionary. It also allows providing a default value ('' in this case) to prevent potential issues.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
debug = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
debug = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting debug mode to False helps prevent potential security risks by disabling the debugger in Werkzeug, which can allow attackers to execute code on the developer's machine.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) on Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11. The safe_join() function failed to properly detect certain absolute paths on Windows, allowing attackers to potentially access files outside the intended directory. An attacker could craft special paths starting with "/" that bypass the directory restrictions on Windows systems. The vulnerability exists in the safe_join() function which relied solely on os.path.isabs() for path validation. This is exploitable on Windows systems by passing paths starting with "/" to safe_join(). To remediate, upgrade to the latest version which includes additional path validation checks. 

NOTE: This vulnerability specifically affects Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11 where ntpath.isabs() behavior differs.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
path = os.path.join('/var/www/uploads/', user_supplied_input)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
path = os.path.join('/var/www/uploads/', os.path.basename(user_supplied_input))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using os.path.basename() on the user-supplied input, we ensure that only the base filename is used in the path and prevent any path traversal vulnerabilities.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are potentially vulnerable to resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms. Applications using 'werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser' to parse 'multipart/form-data' requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.form['data']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.form.get('data')
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using the get() method instead of directly accessing the form data helps prevent potential KeyError if the 'data' key is not found in the form.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_data = request.get_data()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_data = request.get_data(cache=False)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the cache parameter to False, Werkzeug will not cache the request data in memory, preventing potential denial of service attacks by limiting the amount of data that can be processed at a time.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTTP messages by including line feeds (LF) in chunk extensions, potentially bypassing security controls and executing unauthorized actions. The attack vector involves sending specially crafted chunked HTTP requests to exploit the improper parsing in the HttpPayloadParser class. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version which validates chunk extensions by rejecting any containing unexpected LFs, thereby preventing request smuggling attacks.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
async def handle_request(request):
    data = await request.read()
    return web.Response(text=data)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
async def handle_request(request):
    data = await request.read()
    if len(data) > 500:
        return web.Response(status=400, text="Request payload is too large")
    return web.Response(text=data)
```

#### Recommendation Description
Added a check to ensure that the length of the request data is less than 500 bytes before returning the response. This helps prevent potential denial of service attacks or excessive resource consumption.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to Middleware Cache Pollution. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially interfere with middleware handling by exploiting cached middleware associated with system routes. The impact includes possible bypassing of security middleware or unintended access to internal routes. The attack vector involves crafting requests that target system routes, causing the middleware cache to store and reuse inappropriate middleware configurations. The vulnerable methods are _build_middlewares and the middleware caching mechanism in web_app.py. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version, which prevents system routes from polluting the middleware cache by excluding SystemRoute instances from caching.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.middlewares.append(some_middleware)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.middlewares.append(some_middleware) if not isinstance(some_middleware, SystemRoute) else None
```

#### Recommendation Description
This fix ensures that SystemRoute instances are excluded from being added to the middleware list, preventing potential cache pollution vulnerabilities.

**Description**: bandit - Bandit 1.7.7 identifies the str.replace method as a potential risk for SQL injection because it can be misused in constructing SQL queries, potentially enabling the execution of arbitrary SQL code.

https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/pull/1044/commits/d909043ba20853c90a7cad4a5b58a180f6937bf8

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{}'".format(user_input)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using parameterized queries with placeholders, we can prevent SQL injection attacks that could occur when directly formatting user input into the query string.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: jinja2 - A vulnerability in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker who can control both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, bypassing Jinja's sandbox protections. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to manipulate both the template's filename and its contents. The risk depends on the application's specific use case. This issue affects applications that render untrusted templates where the attacker can determine the template filename, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST['template'])
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST.get('template', ''))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the get method instead of directly accessing the 'template' key in the request.POST dictionary, we can avoid potential KeyError if the 'template' key is not present in the dictionary. This helps prevent the possibility of an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the Jinja compiler.

----------------------------------------

**Description**: peewee - Peewee 3.17.1 introduces enhancements to address a race condition issue by implementing stricter locking mechanisms around pool connection management.

https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/commit/ea3fb11a9c2a4b0cd958a453dd287e408477eda5

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
conn = pool.get_connection()
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(sql_query)
results = cursor.fetchall()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
conn = pool.get_connection()
try:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(sql_query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

#### Recommendation Description
This fix ensures that the cursor and connection are always closed properly, even if an exception occurs during the execution of the SQL query.

**Description**: pip - Pip solves a security vulnerability that previously allowed maliciously crafted wheel files to execute unauthorized code during installation.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
password = input("Please enter your password: ")
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
password = getpass.getpass("Please enter your password: ")
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using the getpass module will prevent the password from being displayed in plaintext as the user types it in the terminal.

**Description**: safety - Safety 2.2.0 updates its dependency 'dparse' to include a security fix.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
password = input("Enter your password: ")
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
password = password.strip()
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using getpass.getpass() hides the user input while typing the password. Stripping the input helps remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.

**Description**: setuptools - Affected versions of Setuptools allow for remote code execution via its download functions. These functions, which are used to download packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
url = input("Enter URL: ")
response = requests.get(url)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
url = input("Enter URL: ")
response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By adding a timeout parameter to the requests.get() function, we limit the time the program waits for a response, which helps prevent potential denial of service attacks or other security vulnerabilities related to long response times.
