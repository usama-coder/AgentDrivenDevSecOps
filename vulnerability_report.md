**Description**: flask - Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.
https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' to False, it ensures that the session is not refreshed and re-sent without being accessed or modified, thus reducing the risk of exposing sensitive session data to other clients via caching proxies.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-23934: Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like '=value' instead of 'key=value'. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like '=__Host-test=bad' for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie '=__Host-test=bad' as __Host-test=bad'. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-25577: Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses 'request.data', 'request.form', 'request.files', or 'request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)', it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.data
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)
```

#### Recommendation Description
This fix ensures that the multipart form data parser in Werkzeug does not parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts, which can lead to high resource usage and potential denial of service attacks. By using `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, we can prevent the parser from consuming excessive resources.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 3.0.1 and 2.3.8 include a security fix: Slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS attacks.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/b1916c0c083e0be1c9d887ee2f3d696922bfc5c1

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.get_data()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_data(as_text=True, max_length=500)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By specifying the `as_text=True` parameter, we can ensure that the data is returned as a Unicode string. Additionally, setting the `max_length` parameter to 500 limits the length of the response, preventing potential Denial of Service attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
pin = request.args.get('pin')
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
pin = request.args.get('pin', type=int)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By specifying the data type as 'int', we ensure that the input is converted to an integer, which helps prevent malicious code execution vulnerabilities.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) on Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11. The safe_join() function failed to properly detect certain absolute paths on Windows, allowing attackers to potentially access files outside the intended directory. An attacker could craft special paths starting with "/" that bypass the directory restrictions on Windows systems. The vulnerability exists in the safe_join() function which relied solely on os.path.isabs() for path validation. This is exploitable on Windows systems by passing paths starting with "/" to safe_join(). To remediate, upgrade to the latest version which includes additional path validation checks. 
NOTE: This vulnerability specifically affects Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11 where ntpath.isabs() behavior differs.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
safe_join() function in Werkzeug library
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Upgrade to the latest version of Werkzeug library
```

#### Recommendation Description
The latest version of Werkzeug library includes additional path validation checks to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities on Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11. By upgrading to the latest version, you can mitigate the risk of attackers accessing files outside the intended directory.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are potentially vulnerable to resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms. Applications using 'werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser' to parse 'multipart/form-data' requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    file.save(secure_filename(file.filename))
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    if len(filename) > 500:
        abort(400, "Filename is too long")
    file.save(filename)
```

#### Recommendation Description
This fix ensures that the length of the filename is checked before saving the file to prevent any potential resource exhaustion attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.get_data()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_data(as_text=True, parse_form_data=True)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the `as_text=True` and `parse_form_data=True` parameters in the `get_data()` method, the data will be parsed and processed as text, which helps prevent denial of service attacks through crafted multipart data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTTP messages by including line feeds (LF) in chunk extensions, potentially bypassing security controls and executing unauthorized actions. The attack vector involves sending specially crafted chunked HTTP requests to exploit the improper parsing in the HttpPayloadParser class. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version which validates chunk extensions by rejecting any containing unexpected LFs, thereby preventing request smuggling attacks.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.router.add_get('/api/data', handle_data)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.router.add_get('/api/data', handle_data, expect_handler=aiohttp.web.Request.app.handle_request)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By adding the `expect_handler` parameter with the value of `aiohttp.web.Request.app.handle_request`, we ensure that the request is properly handled and prevent HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerabilities in aiohttp.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to Middleware Cache Pollution. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially interfere with middleware handling by exploiting cached middleware associated with system routes. The impact includes possible bypassing of security middleware or unintended access to internal routes. The attack vector involves crafting requests that target system routes, causing the middleware cache to store and reuse inappropriate middleware configurations. The vulnerable methods are _build_middlewares and the middleware caching mechanism in web_app.py. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version, which prevents system routes from polluting the middleware cache by excluding SystemRoute instances from caching.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
web_app.py - caching mechanism for middleware
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Upgrade aiohttp to the latest version to prevent system routes from polluting the middleware cache.
```

#### Recommendation Description
By upgrading to the latest version of aiohttp, SystemRoute instances will be excluded from caching in the middleware cache, preventing potential exploitation of Middleware Cache Pollution vulnerability.

https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/pull/1044/commits/d909043ba20853c90a7cad4a5b58a180f6937bf8

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}'".format(username)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using parameterized queries with placeholders (%s) instead of string formatting, we can prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: jinja2 - A vulnerability in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker who can control both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, bypassing Jinja's sandbox protections. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to manipulate both the template's filename and its contents. The risk depends on the application's specific use case. This issue affects applications that render untrusted templates where the attacker can determine the template filename, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST['template'])
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
template = Template(request.POST.get('template', ''))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the get method with a default empty string value, we can prevent potential code injection by not allowing direct access to the request.POST dictionary.

https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6h8p-4hx9-w66c

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
```

#### Recommendation Description

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - langchain-ai/langchain is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in its LocalFileStore functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read or write files anywhere on the filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution. The issue lies in the handling of file paths in the mset and mget methods, where user-supplied input is not adequately sanitized, allowing directory traversal sequences to reach unintended directories.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(self.base_path, key)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(self.base_path), os.path.basename(key))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.basename`, we ensure that the file path is normalized and restricted to the base path directory, preventing any potential path traversal attacks.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - In versions of Langchain-ai before 0.1.0, a vulnerability exists where a crawler, using a specified configuration, could mistakenly download malicious content from an external site. This occurs when an attacker adds a malicious HTML file on https://example.com that includes links to outside sites, contrary to the crawler's settings intended to restrict such actions.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.text
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = requests.get(url, verify=True)
data = response.text
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the 'verify' parameter to True when making the request, the requests library will verify the SSL certificate of the server, helping to mitigate the risk of downloading malicious content from an external site.

https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18600

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, user_input)
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
if not user_input.endswith('.txt'):
    raise ValueError("Invalid file type")
file_path = os.path.join(base_path, user_input)
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

#### Recommendation Description
Ensure that the user input file path ends with '.txt' to prevent path traversal attacks. By restricting the file type, we can mitigate the risk of accessing unintended files on the system.

**Description**: langchain - langchain_experimental (aka LangChain Experimental) in LangChain before 0.1.8 allows an attacker to bypass the CVE-2023-44467 fix and execute arbitrary code via the __import__, __subclasses__, __builtins__, __globals__, __getattribute__, __bases__, __mro__, or __base__ attribute in Python code. These are not prohibited by pal_chain/base.py. See CVE-2024-27444.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
exec(user_input)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use a safer alternative to exec, such as ast.literal_eval or parsing the user input in a more controlled manner using a parser library.
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using exec to directly execute user input can be extremely dangerous as it allows for arbitrary code execution, opening up the possibility of code injection attacks. By using safer alternatives or parsing the input in a controlled manner, the risk of code injection can be mitigated.

**Description**: langchain - An issue in LangChain v.0.0.231 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the prompt parameter.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
prompt = input("Enter your name: ")
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
prompt = input("Enter your name: ").strip()
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using the strip() method will remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the user input, reducing the risk of code injection vulnerabilities.
