### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: flask - Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.
https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.config['SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST'] = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' to False, the session will no longer be refreshed on each request, reducing the risk of potential caching vulnerabilities.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-23934: Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like '=value' instead of 'key=value'. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like '=__Host-test=bad' for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie '=__Host-test=bad' as __Host-test=bad'. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-px8h-6qxv-m22q

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
cookie_value = request.cookies.get('cookie_name', '')
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
cookie_value = request.cookies.get('cookie_name')[:500]
```

#### Recommendation Description
Limiting the length of the cookie value retrieved from the request to 500 characters helps prevent potential buffer overflow or denial of service attacks that may exploit excessively long cookie values.

**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 2.2.3 includes a fix for CVE-2023-25577: Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses 'request.data', 'request.form', 'request.files', or 'request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)', it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
data = request.get_data()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_data(parse_form_data=True)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By explicitly setting parse_form_data=True, we ensure that only form data is parsed from the request, preventing the parsing of potentially malicious multipart data that could lead to resource exhaustion.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug 3.0.1 and 2.3.8 include a security fix: Slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS attacks.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = request.form['user_input']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = request.form.get('user_input', '')
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using the get method with a default value helps to prevent potential KeyError if the 'user_input' key is not found in the form data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
debug = True
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
debug = False
```

#### Recommendation Description
Setting debug mode to False will disable the Werkzeug debugger, reducing the risk of allowing an attacker to execute code on the developer's machine.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) on Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11. The safe_join() function failed to properly detect certain absolute paths on Windows, allowing attackers to potentially access files outside the intended directory. An attacker could craft special paths starting with "/" that bypass the directory restrictions on Windows systems. The vulnerability exists in the safe_join() function which relied solely on os.path.isabs() for path validation. This is exploitable on Windows systems by passing paths starting with "/" to safe_join(). To remediate, upgrade to the latest version which includes additional path validation checks. 
NOTE: This vulnerability specifically affects Windows systems running Python versions below 3.11 where ntpath.isabs() behavior differs.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
path = os.path.join(base_path, user_supplied_path)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(base_path, user_supplied_path))
```

#### Recommendation Description
Using os.path.normpath() will normalize the path and remove any occurrences of '.' and '..' to prevent directory traversal attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Affected versions of Werkzeug are potentially vulnerable to resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms. Applications using 'werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser' to parse 'multipart/form-data' requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
form = request.form['input_data']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
form = request.form.get('input_data')
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using the get() method instead of directly accessing the form data, we can avoid potential security vulnerabilities such as KeyError if the 'input_data' key does not exist in the form data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: werkzeug - Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_data = request.files['file'].read()
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_data = request.files['file'].read(max_length)
```

#### Recommendation Description
Limit the maximum length of data read from the file to prevent denial of service attacks caused by sending large amounts of data.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to Middleware Cache Pollution. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially interfere with middleware handling by exploiting cached middleware associated with system routes. The impact includes possible bypassing of security middleware or unintended access to internal routes. The attack vector involves crafting requests that target system routes, causing the middleware cache to store and reuse inappropriate middleware configurations. The vulnerable methods are _build_middlewares and the middleware caching mechanism in web_app.py. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version, which prevents system routes from polluting the middleware cache by excluding SystemRoute instances from caching.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.middlewares.extend(middlewares)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.middlewares.extend(list(middlewares))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By converting `middlewares` to a list before extending `app.middlewares`, we ensure that we are not directly modifying the original `middlewares` list. This prevents potential cache pollution and ensures that the middleware configurations are not inadvertently altered.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: aiohttp - Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTTP messages by including line feeds (LF) in chunk extensions, potentially bypassing security controls and executing unauthorized actions. The attack vector involves sending specially crafted chunked HTTP requests to exploit the improper parsing in the HttpPayloadParser class. To mitigate, upgrade to aiohttp version which validates chunk extensions by rejecting any containing unexpected LFs, thereby preventing request smuggling attacks.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
app.router.add_get('/v1/data', handle_data)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
app.router.add_get('/v1/data', handle_data, expect_handler=handle_expect)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By adding the `expect_handler` parameter to the `add_get` method, we can specify a handler function to validate the `Expect` header in the HTTP request, which helps prevent HTTP request smuggling attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: bandit - Bandit 1.7.7 identifies the str.replace method as a potential risk for SQL injection because it can be misused in constructing SQL queries, potentially enabling the execution of arbitrary SQL code.
https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/pull/1044/commits/d909043ba20853c90a7cad4a5b58a180f6937bf8

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using parameterized queries with placeholders (%s) and passing the username as a parameter to the execute method, we can prevent SQL injection attacks.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: jinja2 - A vulnerability in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker who can control both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, bypassing Jinja's sandbox protections. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to manipulate both the template's filename and its contents. The risk depends on the application's specific use case. This issue affects applications that render untrusted templates where the attacker can determine the template filename, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
template = Template(data, filename=filename)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
template = Template(data)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By removing the filename parameter from the Template instantiation, we prevent an attacker from potentially exploiting the Jinja vulnerability by controlling both the content and filename of the template. This helps to improve the security of the application.

```python
data = request.get_json()['data']
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
data = request.get_json(silent=True, force=True)['data']
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the `silent=True` and `force=True` parameters in the `get_json` method, we ensure that the code does not raise an exception if the data is not in JSON format, and it forces the parsing of the data as JSON regardless. This helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities related to unexpected data types.

----------------------------------------

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - Affected versions of Langchain allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the PALChain in the python exec method. The PALChain class requires unique security considerations so it was moved langchain-experimental package and removed from langchain on version 0.0.247. The issue was attempted to be resolved several times in langchain-experimental but the fixes were found incomplete. See CVE-2023-44467, CVE-2024-27444, and CVE-2024-38459.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
exec(response)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
# Replace exec(response) with a safer alternative, such as using eval() if necessary
```

#### Recommendation Description

**Description**: langchain - LangChain before 0.0.317 allows SSRF via document_loaders/recursive_url_loader.py because crawling can proceed from an external server to an internal server.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
```

#### Recommendation Description
By adding a timeout parameter to the requests.get() function, we can prevent potential SSRF attacks by limiting the time the request can take to complete. This helps to mitigate the risk of an attacker using the server as a proxy to access internal resources.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - langchain-ai/langchain is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in its LocalFileStore functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read or write files anywhere on the filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution. The issue lies in the handling of file paths in the mset and mget methods, where user-supplied input is not adequately sanitized, allowing directory traversal sequences to reach unintended directories.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
file_path = os.path.join(self.base_dir, file_name)
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
file_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(self.base_dir, file_name))
```

#### Recommendation Description
By using `os.path.abspath()` function, we ensure that the file path is resolved to an absolute path, preventing any relative path traversal attacks.

### File: requirements.txt, Line: 1
**Description**: langchain - In versions of Langchain-ai before 0.1.0, a vulnerability exists where a crawler, using a specified configuration, could mistakenly download malicious content from an external site. This occurs when an attacker adds a malicious HTML file on https://example.com that includes links to outside sites, contrary to the crawler's settings intended to restrict such actions.

**Severity**: HIGH

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
response = requests.get(url)
content = response.text
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
response = requests.get(url, verify=True)
content = response.text
```

#### Recommendation Description
By setting the 'verify' parameter to True in the requests.get() function, we ensure that the SSL certificate of the website is verified, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring that the content is retrieved securely.
