# Code Vulnerabilities Report

## Total Vulnerabilities Detected: **1**

---

### File: codeScan.py, Line: 19
**Description**: Possible hardcoded password: 'SuperSecret123'

**Severity**: LOW

#### Vulnerable Code
```python
password = 'SuperSecret123'
```

#### Recommended Fix Code
```python
Use environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information like passwords and access them in your code.
```

#### Recommendation Description
Storing passwords directly in the code makes it vulnerable to being exposed if the code is shared or leaked. By using environment variables or a configuration file, you can keep sensitive information separate from the codebase.
