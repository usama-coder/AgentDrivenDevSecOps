Recommended fix:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://example.com', verify=True)\n```\n\n3. Explanation:\nSetting `verify=True` in the requests call enables SSL certificate checks, ensuring that the HTTPS connection is secure and the server's identity is validated. Disabling SSL certificate checks by setting `verify=False` can leave the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security risks. By setting `verify=True`, the fix ensures that the SSL certificate of the server is verified, thus enhancing the security of the connection."}}
