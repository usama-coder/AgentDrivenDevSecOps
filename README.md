# Python Vulnerability Detection and Remediation Tool

This tool identifies vulnerabilities in Python code and provides actionable remediation recommendations. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the code, recommend fixes, and generate detailed Markdown reports.

## Features

- **Code Analysis**: Scans Python files for vulnerabilities.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses an LLM to provide precise and actionable recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities.
- **Markdown Reports**: Generates detailed reports highlighting:
  - Vulnerable code.
  - Recommended fixes.
  - Explanation of how the fix resolves the issue.
- **Supports Multiple Issues**: Handles multiple vulnerabilities in a single run.
- **Reflection**: Evaluates the quality of the output and adapts dynamically.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the tool, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9+
pip (Python package manager)
Git (optional but recommended)
OpenAI API key for LLM-based features (e.g., remediation/fixes)
